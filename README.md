# 7 Segment Display Text
This is a function that returns the longest word you can print on a seven digit display in addition to a calculator held upside down with a size digit display.

This project is inspired by Tom Scott's video on [seven segment displays](https://youtu.be/zp4BMR88260) using this [Github repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) of every English word.
